Name: 			PMStars
Descripcion: 	PMStars will display the starfield.
Date: 			2023-11-16
Version:		1.01
----------------------------   


DESCRIPTION
-----------
PMStars will display the starfield with either a single 'dot' or line for each star.

PMStars is a PM program that Don Moore wrote to learn about the OS/2 GPI and the PM timer function.  A simple starfield program.

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
-------------------
Double click the PMStars.exe (or PMStarsd.exe) file to start:

 PMStars will display the starfield with either a single 'dot' or
line for each star.  The line length depends on the stars speed.
	-> Use LMB (left mouse button) to set the star's origin,
	RMB (right mouse button) to switch between 'dot' and line.
Resize the window for some interesting (and intentional) effects !

PMStarsd will display the starfield with either a line or a star number.
    -> LMB will set the star's origin (and marker, if applic),
	RMB will switch between line and star numbers.
This program varient was used during debugging, and I thought it might be helpful to include it in the distribution.


REQUIREMENTS
------------
- yum install git gcc make libc-devel binutils watcom-wrc watcom-wlink-hll

COMPILE INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------
This version of this sample was modified to compile on ArcaOS with GCC 9 compiler. 

1) Remember to have correct header files your path. For GCC the correct ones are the included on the "libc-devel", not the ones from the OS/2 Toolkit. Check your config.sys for "SET INCLUDE=C:\usr\include"

2) Since I'm using the Watcom Resource Compiler (open source) instead of the classic rc.exe, and the the Watcom Linker, intead of the classic ilink.exe, add to your config.sys...
 SET EMXOMFLD_LINKER=wl.exe
 SET EMXOMFLD_TYPE=WLINK
 SET EMXOMFLD_RC_TYPE=WRC
 SET EMXOMFLD_RC=wrc.exe

3) Run "make" or "make 2>&1 |tee make.out" to get the log file.


TOOLS USED
----------
- ArcaOS	- Verion 5.1
- wrc 		- Version 2.0beta1
- gcc		- gcc (GCC) 9.2.0 20190812 (OS/2 RPM build 9.2.0-5.oc00)
- make 		- Version 3.81 k2 (2017-11-10)

TROUBLESHOOT
------------
The compile produce will run by just executing make on the directory, but a compile.cmd file is includes to store the log in a file. If you want to save the log file you can run it as "nmake 2>&1 |tee make.out". The log will be saved into the "make.out" file.
